										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Perhaps you’ve driven by a salvage lot and wondered what people do with all those old cars. Commonly, lots scrap them for parts, metal, and wiring. But who buys these used auto parts, and why?</p>
<p>Finding and buying parts at a junkyard saves more money than ordering through a dealership or independent seller. Additionally, some car owners own a specific model where finding parts is challenging. From DIY car repairs to auto shop classes, here are the primary buyers of used car parts.</p>
<h2>DIY Car Repair</h2>
<p>Many people shop at auto salvage yards to find replacement parts for their specific vehicles. Most car owners take their cars to a mechanic for service, but some like to get dirty with their car repairs. It is often more cost-efficient to visit a junkyard than buying through independent sellers, auto shops, or dealerships.</p>
<p>Finding specific parts is also challenging if the car owner has a unique vehicle, like an import. Junkyards have a vast assortment of domestic and foreign parts and components that are hard to find elsewhere.</p>
<h2>Car Restoration Enthusiasts</h2>
<p>When you visit an auto show, it’s impressive to see the old models of yesteryear. Yet, these cars don’t come prebuilt. Most often, devoted car enthusiasts spend the skills, time, and patience restoring these cars to their former glory. Therefore, these restoration projects require specific engines, transmissions, and other car parts only found at salvage yards.</p>
<h2>Auto Shops and Schools</h2>
<p>Some auto shops purchase salvage yard car parts for their high quality and low cost. They can also order wholesale to restock their inventories.</p>
<p>Similarly, high schools and colleges with auto shop classes purchase salvage cars and independent components for class projects. Students gain hands-on practice, improving their skills in auto repair.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="left">When winter sets in, there&#8217;s nothing more frustrating than having your wiper fluid freeze. You&#8217;re driving down the road when suddenly slush and grime cover your windshield. You try to wipe it off, but your wiper fluid won&#8217;t spray! The windshield wiper fluid is frozen!</p>
<p align="left">Don&#8217;t worry. In this blog, we&#8217;ll show you how to thaw frozen washer fluid lines and get your windshield clear again.</p>
<h2 class="western">Why Does Wiper Fluid Freeze?</h2>
<p align="left">Wiper fluid can freeze when the cold temperature drops below freezing (32 degrees Fahrenheit), clogging your wiper fluid lines with ice. When this happens, unfreeze your windshield washer fluid fast to drive safely on the wintery road.</p>
<h2 class="western">How to Unfreeze Your Windshield Washer Fluid</h2>
<p align="left">Follow these steps to unfreeze your wiper fluid:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p align="left"><b>Warm Up Your Car:</b> Start the car and let it sit idle for a few minutes to warm up the engine. Turn the heat on. Not only will this warm up your car, but it can help thaw the windshield wiper fluid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left"><b>Thawing Fluid Lines:</b> Park your car in a heated garage or use a space heater to warm the lines. Never use an open flame or boiling water. These can damage the lines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left"><b>Use De-Icer:</b> You can purchase a commercial windshield washer de-icer from your local auto parts store. Add this de-icer to your washer fluid reservoir to help prevent freezing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left"><b>Windshield Washer Fluid:</b> Use a high-quality winter-grade washer fluid that contains antifreeze. The chemicals in the fluid allow it to withstand colder temperatures.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">With these simple steps, your windshield wiper fluid should unfreeze and work properly.</p>
<p align="left"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1375" src="http://www.aeroautoparts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/WasherFulid.jpg" alt="" width="1254" height="836" srcset="https://www.aeroautoparts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/WasherFulid.jpg 1254w, https://www.aeroautoparts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/WasherFulid-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.aeroautoparts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/WasherFulid-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.aeroautoparts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/WasherFulid-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1254px) 100vw, 1254px" /></p>
<h2 class="western">Preventing Frozen Windshield Wiper Lines</h2>
<p align="left">Dealing with a frozen windshield wiper line is a common issue during winter. To avoid this problem in the future, use winter-grade washer fluid in the reservoir and keep it filled to prevent grime and ice buildup.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let’s begin this post by saying a couple of obvious things. First, as we said in an earlier post, the prices of both new and used cars are skyrocketing with no leveling off in sight. Second, your car is not going to maintain itself, and if you want to keep it running well beyond the 100,000-mile mark, proper maintenance is essential.</p>
<h2>5 Maintenance Basics</h2>
<p>With those basic facts in mind, here are five tips anyone can follow to keep your current vehicle in top shape and operating safely and efficiently for thousands of miles to come.</p>
<h3>Be familiar with the owner’s manual</h3>
<p>The owner’s manual for your car contains a world of valuable information that far too many motorists ignore. Pay particular attention to the manufacturer&#8217;s recommended maintenance schedule and follow it. Following this schedule will help maximize the lifespan of your car while also avoiding unneeded repairs and replacements that some mechanics might try to talk you into.</p>
<h3>Maintain your tires</h3>
<p>Two things are essential when it comes to tire maintenance. First, check the tire pressure regularly and follow the manufacturer’s instructions on the proper pressure to maintain. Tires that are either under or over inflated can wear out much quicker than those in which the right pressure is maintained.</p>
<p>Second, have your tires rotated every six months or every 6,000 to 8,000 miles. Rotating your tires means taking them off and putting them in a different position so that they wear evenly and last longer.</p>
<h3>Change your motor oil regularly</h3>
<p>OK, but what does “regularly” mean today? There was a time long ago when that meant having your oil changed every 1,000 miles or so, but that is no longer the case. Most of today’s engines are built to need an oil change about every six months, or every 5,000 miles. </p>
<p>However, if you drive in a lot of stop-and-go traffic, you might want to have it changed more frequently. And between changes, check your oil level periodically to spot potential problems like a leak that’s causing the level to drop. Oil is absolutely essential to keep the moving parts of your car operating efficiently.</p>
<h3>Check the coolant</h3>
<p>Like oil, coolant is another essential fluid needed to prevent engine overheating and keep it operating efficiently. One of the last things you want is a slow leak that drains your coolant, leaving you with an overheated engine. So, periodically check beneath your car to see if there are any leaks and look under the radiator cap to make sure you have an adequate amount of coolant.<br />
 It’s also a good idea to keep a supply of 50/50 coolant on hand to put in the radiator when needed to avoid an overheated engine that leaves you stranded. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="http://www.aeroautoparts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/4.jpg" alt="" width="1334" height="787" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1320" srcset="https://www.aeroautoparts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/4.jpg 1334w, https://www.aeroautoparts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/4-300x177.jpg 300w, https://www.aeroautoparts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/4-1024x604.jpg 1024w, https://www.aeroautoparts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/4-768x453.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1334px) 100vw, 1334px" /></p>
<h3>Check your battery</h3>
<p>The last thing you want is to be left stranded with a dead battery, and to avoid that, when you’re getting the oil changed, ask your mechanic to check your battery. Today’s batteries should last between 4 to 6 years, and if yours is in that age range, it’s a good idea to replace it.</p>
<h2>Used Car Parts in United States</h2>
<p>In addition to extending the life of your car by following these five basic tips, another way you can save money is by using used auto parts for repairs. Initially, you might shy away from the idea of using used car parts on your vehicle. But rest assured that any <a href="https://www.aeroautoparts.com/United States-il-used-auto-parts/">used parts</a> you buy from 3Brothers Garage have been carefully examined and evaluated by our parts experts to be sure they’re perfectly safe and dependable to be placed in your vehicle.</p>
<p>So, save a lot of money by following these maintenance tips, and the next time you need auto parts, make 3Brothers Garage your first and only stop. We’ve been serving motorists in the United States area for over 50 years, and we want to help you, too!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Anyone who has checked vehicle prices lately knows they’re skyrocketing, with no relief in sight. Presently, the average price of a new car in the U.S. is slightly over $47,000, an all-time high. For used cars, the average is about $27,500, a 35 percent increase since the beginning of 2021.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anyone who has checked vehicle prices lately knows they’re skyrocketing, with no relief in sight. Presently, the average price of a new car in the U.S. is slightly over $47,000, an all-time high. For used cars, the average is about $27,500, a 35 percent increase since the beginning of 2021.</p>
<p>The reasons for these surges are pretty obvious. COVID-induced labor shortages, supply chain issues, and a critical shortage of microchips have all contributed to a short supply of new vehicles and surging prices. The scarcity of new vehicles and the higher prices have carried over into the used car market.</p>
<p>Car dealers get much of their supply of used cars through trade-ins as their customers purchase new cars. With fewer new cars to sell, however, there are not as many used cars to be resold. At the end of 2021, nationally the supply of used cars on the market was about 16 percent less than at the beginning of the year. That scarcity, like the limited availability of new cars, has had the effect of driving prices skyward.</p>
<p>Given these price increases, with no decline in sight on the horizon, for many of us it just makes sense to keep your present vehicle running as long as possible to save money. Further, when it comes to the repairs needed to keep your “old faithful” on the road, you can save even more with used auto parts.</p>
<h2>Cheap Auto Parts in United States – An Auto Parts Primer</h2>
<p>For those who may not have paid much attention to the topic earlier, here’s a brief summation of the most commonly available auto parts and what auto repair shops and insurance companies think about them.</p>
<h2>OEM Parts</h2>
<p>That stands for original equipment manufacturer, the original pieces of equipment produced by the vehicle’s manufacturer. OEMs are brand-new, never-used parts. They’re more expensive, and most repair shops don’t keep a ready supply of them. So, they have to be ordered from the manufacturer, and that can delay the repair process.</p>
<p>On the other hand, repair shops actually like OEM parts because they fit perfectly without having to make any adjustments. Insurance companies, on the other hand, are not so enthused about OEM parts. Yes, they want to get your car back on the road, but they also want to keep their costs down.</p>
<p>So, your insurance company may pay for OEM parts only if no others are available, or if you have an OEM clause in your policy. You’ll have to pay extra for OEM coverage, however.</p>
<h2>Aftermarket Parts</h2>
<p>These are parts produced by a company other than your vehicle’s original manufacturer. These parts are new and have never been used on another vehicle. They’re similar to an off-brand version of one of your favorite foods, cheaper than the original, but they usually work quite well.</p>
<p>Repair shops can get your vehicle back on the road using aftermarket parts, but adjustments sometimes must be made to make the parts fit correctly. Insurance companies love aftermarket parts as a means of keeping their costs down. Frankly, if aftermarket parts were never used, insurance rates would soar.</p>
<h2>Used Parts</h2>
<p>They’re exactly what they say they are, parts that have been used on another vehicle. Many vehicles are junked and discarded for various reasons. Anything from a wreck that totals the vehicle to an engine or transmission failure on an older vehicle may cause it to wind up in a salvage yard.</p>
<p>While junked, the vehicle probably has a lot of usable parts that can be salvaged and used to repair other vehicles. One of the great things about used parts is that they are usually OEM parts. They’ve just been previously used.</p>
<p>Repair shops and insurance companies both like used parts. Since many of them are, as we said, actually OEM parts, they can be used easily to make repairs and often work as well as new parts. And because they’re cheaper than new parts, insurance companies like them as a way of keeping their costs down.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1315" src="http://www.aeroautoparts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2.jpg" alt="" width="1254" height="836" srcset="https://www.aeroautoparts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2.jpg 1254w, https://www.aeroautoparts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.aeroautoparts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.aeroautoparts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1254px) 100vw, 1254px" /></p>
<h2>Don’t Worry About Used Parts</h2>
<p>It’s easy to understand that a person might be hesitant about repairing their damaged or broken vehicle with used parts. To overcome your hesitancy, you can be assured that no reputable repair shop would put used parts on your vehicle if they’re truly junk parts beyond repair. You also need to remember that if you’re driving an older vehicle, repairing it with used parts may be the only option to keep it running and out on the road.</p>
<p>Finally, for a little extra assurance about used parts, here are a few examples of where they can be used to save money.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tires – You can save hundreds of dollars shopping for used tires that still have usable tread. That helps a lot when you’re just trying to keep an older vehicle running a little longer to avoid paying for an expensive new or used car.</li>
<li>Alternators – This part should last between 80,000 and 100,000 miles, and one with just a few thousand miles on it should last for many years.</li>
<li>Body parts ­– A lot of money can be saved finding used fenders, bumpers, and doors to repair your vehicle after a wreck.</li>
<li>Lighting – It’s easy to find used headlights, fog lights and taillights for repairs.</li>
<li>AC compressor – You need a cool vehicle to get through our hot, sticky summers, and you can save hundreds by replacing a failed compressor with a used one.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p lang="en-IN" align="justify">While we are in the business of selling <a href="https://www.aeroautoparts.com/" title="Used Auto Parts United States">used auto parts in United States</a>, we want to help you minimize your vehicle’s problems, while maximizing its performance and efficiency. One way of accomplishing this is through proper maintenance of your vehicle’s cooling system. This important system keeps you comfortable in the passenger cabin while also keeping your engine running smoothly while preventing it from overheating.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1311" src="http://www.aeroautoparts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image8.png" alt="" width="612" height="367" srcset="https://www.aeroautoparts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image8.png 612w, https://www.aeroautoparts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image8-300x180.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" /></p>
<p lang="en-IN" align="justify">While proper maintenance of your vehicle’s cooling system is extremely important, about 28% of the vehicles on America’s roads are operating with inadequate maintenance and protection. If you can’t remember the last time you had your vehicle’s radiator flushed and the coolant replaced, your vehicle falls into this category. It is likely time for you to pay a bit more attention to your vehicle’s cooling system &#8211; and we’ll tell you why.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">How the Cooling System Works</h2>
<p lang="en-IN" align="justify">Your vehicle’s cooling system is designed to cool your engine while it is running, and it is a circulating process that begins in the radiator. Stated simply, coolant travels from the radiator, then circulates through the engine while drawing away engine heat. The coolant then returns to the radiator where the fan and air flowing through the fins of the radiator reduces the temperature of the coolant. It then returns to the engine once again, and thus, continues the cooling cycle.</p>
<p lang="en-IN" align="justify">The coolant is designed to protect the running engine from overheating, and it also protects vital parts in the cooling system against corrosion. When the coolant gets old, it cannot do its job properly, and you run the risk of repeatedly overheating your engine which can lead to extensive and expensive repairs..</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Signs of a Cooling System Problem</h2>
<p lang="en-IN">Here are some things to watch for that may indicate you have a problem with your cooling system.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Engine Overheating</strong> – Any number of things can cause your engine to overheat &#8211; like a broken water pump or a broken belt &#8211; to name two. If your engine’s temperature warning light comes on, it’s best to either pull over and call for a tow, or let it cool completely and add a 50/50 antifreeze mixture to fill the radiator and cautiously make your way to the repair shop. Continuing to drive while the engine is overheated could lead to permanent engine damage.</li>
<li><strong>The Smell of Antifreeze</strong> – The smell of <a href="https://www.aeroautoparts.com/blog/the-importance-of-antifreeze/" title="The Importance Of Antifreeze">antifreeze</a> when driving or right after you’ve stopped your vehicle indicates a leak in the system, often indicating that antifreeze is dripping onto your hot engine or leaking into the passenger compartment due to a faulty heater core. This problem requires immediate attention.</li>
<li><strong>Antifreeze</strong> on the Ground – A puddle of coolant under your vehicle is another indication of a leak that prevents the cooling system from protecting your engine against overheating.</li>
<li><strong>Coolant Level is Perpetually Low</strong> – Having to add coolant regularly is still another sign of a leak in the cooling system.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Cooling System Maintenance</h2>
<p lang="en-IN">At 3Brothers Garage, the home of high-quality, cheap auto parts in Illinois, we have a few tips we think might be helpful to properly maintain your vehicle’s cooling system.</p>
<ul>
<li>Check the radiator, belts and hoses regularly and have them replaced when they begin to show signs of wear.</li>
<li>Replace the drive belt – also known as the serpentine belt – if it is beginning to show any signs of wear. Check your owner’s manual for replacement information or ask your mechanic for his opinion.</li>
<li>Have the cooling system properly serviced. At least once every two years the old fluid should be drained, the system flushed, and new coolant added.</li>

<li>Increase Your Safety</li>
<li>Longevity</li>
<li>Enhance Performance and Reliability</li>
<li>Save on Expensive Repairs</li>
<li>Minimize Roadside Emergencies</li>
<li>Increase Your Vehicle’s Resale Value</li>
<li>Help Protect the Environment</li>
</ul>
<p>If you drive a vehicle in the United States area, it is important to realize how important regular maintenance is to your driving experience. Below are some specifics relating to the listed benefits.</p>
<h2 class="seo_h2"><strong>Increasing Your Safety</strong></h2>
<p>Some vehicle accidents are related to improper vehicle maintenance. For example, if you have neglected to maintain your brake system and your brakes malfunction when you need to stop or slow down, this will likely cause an accident. Similarly, if you do not check your tire pressure and tread wear regularly, you could suffer a blowout while you are driving at high speed or find yourself skidding on wet pavement when you hit the brakes.<br />
Regular maintenance can help you avoid these situations – potentially saving your life.</p>
<h2 class="seo_h2"><strong>Longevity</strong></h2>
<p>You have probably seen a car that is likely more than 10, 15, or even 20 years old, but still looks like new. This is an example of how a well-maintained, older car can outshine a newer car that has been neglected. Very often, it is the little things like regularly checking your fluid levels, tire pressure, battery, brakes, and lights that make a huge difference in the long run.</p>
<h2 class="seo_h2"><strong>Enhancing Performance and Reliability</strong></h2>
<p>Engine performance is directly related to proper maintenance, and if you drive any vehicle long enough without changing the oil, checking the transmission fluid, and performing regular tune-ups, you will notice a definite decline in performance.<br />
Additionally, if you intend to rely on your vehicle, you need to remember it relies on you too. Many vehicle components need to be serviced or replaced on a regular schedule – by doing this, you will be eliminating the likelihood of dealing with expensive repairs and emergency tows.</p>
<h2 class="seo_h2"><strong>Save on Expensive Repairs</strong></h2>
<p>As with most things, prevention is better than the cure. By scheduling regular maintenance check-ups, replacing worn <a title="Auto Parts United States" href="https://www.aeroautoparts.com/">auto parts in United States</a>, and paying attention to anything out of the ordinary when it comes to your car, you will most likely be able to avoid costly repair bills. Conversely, if you neglect your vehicle maintenance, there will come a time when you will have to spend more money trying to fix your car than it would cost you to replace it.</p>
<h2 class="seo_h2"><strong>Minimize Roadside Emergencies</strong></h2>
<p>It is beyond aggravating when your car engine refuses to start on a cold winter morning or breaks down without warning on the side of the road. Even worse, you could find yourself stuck in the middle of nowhere without a cell signal – having to walk for help. You can minimize the risk of roadside emergencies by taking good care of your vehicle, whether you choose quality used auto parts, or brand-new ones.</p>
<h2 class="seo_h2"><strong>Increase Your Vehicle’s Resale Value</strong></h2>
<p>If you have ever wondered why some used and classic cars seem to command a higher price when they are sold – sometimes decades after they were originally manufactured – it is usually because the owner(s) took meticulous care of those vehicles. This is particularly relevant if you have a rare or limited-edition model.</p>
<h2 class="seo_h2"><strong>Help Protect the Environment</strong></h2>
<p>Whether protecting the environment is a passion or you are simply concerned about passing your vehicle emission test, you will benefit from replacing worn out components on your vehicle. At 3Brothers Garage, you will find all the affordable, <a href="https://www.aeroautoparts.com/United States-il-wholesale-car-and-truck-parts/" title="Wholesale Auto Parts United Stateslinois">wholesale car parts in Illinois</a> you need to keep your older car in compliance with environmental protection standards.</p>
<h2 class="seo_h2"><strong>How to Keep Your Vehicle Maintained Well Past the 100,000 Mile Mark</strong></h2>
<p>Beginning with our next blog, we will be providing the information you need to keep your vehicle systems running properly in United States. Additionally, we will be posting tips to help you keep your car’s interior and exterior looking good as the miles add up. Check back soon to learn about breaking in a new car properly.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Drivers often hear about winter driving tips, but autumn has its own set of road hazards that everyone should consider when they get behind the wheel. Here are some things to watch for as well as some tips to help keep you safe as the seasons change.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Darkness</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As the days grow shorter, many people will find themselves driving in the dark more often. It’s important to realize that color recognition, depth perception, and peripheral vision are compromised when it is dark out. The glare of oncoming headlights can also make it more difficult to see. Allowing extra space between vehicles, wearing special glasses designed for night driving, and making sure you wear your prescription glasses if you need them, can help you avoid accidents when driving at night.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Kids</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Not only are kids back in school, but new drivers are on the road who may not have much experience driving. Be especially careful in school zones where new drivers may be coming and going as they pick up their siblings or friends. School buses are also out on the road once again. Be prepared to stop when they stop – and never pass a school bus, in either direction, when they are picking up or dropping off children.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Critters</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier dusk makes it more likely deer will be out at the same time you are. In fact, statistics indicate that you are 3.5 times more likely to hit an animal, especially a deer, in November than in any other month. This is partly because mating season for deer occurs in November. Exercise extra caution when driving on rural, two-lane roads, as that is where most animal/vehicle collisions occur.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Leaves</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As beautiful as the autumn leaves are, they present a couple of issues when it comes to driving. A mat of fallen leaves makes it more difficult to stop due to reduced traction, and when there is an especially beautiful stand of trees, motorists will often slow down to take a better look. Be extra careful to avoid rear-end collisions at this time of year.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Prepare your Vehicle for Autumn with Quality Used Auto Parts in United Stateslinois</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Every driver strives to avoid accidents, and one way to do that is to make sure your vehicle is in perfect working order. If you are preparing your car for the upcoming season and you are in need of quality <a href="https://www.aeroautoparts.com/" title="Used Auto Parts in United States">used auto parts in United Stateslinois</a>, check out our selection at 3Brothers Garage.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have a heap of a car taking up space in your driveway or garage, there’s a good chance you’re feeling unsure about what to do with it. You could fix it up or work to find a buyer, but there’s a strong argument to be made for selling it for parts. Today, we’ll name some of the main reasons vehicle owners make this choice.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Cash on the spot</span></h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your garage or driveway may feel cramped and useless </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">now</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but you’re bound to see much more potential in the space once the junk car is gone. Get the useless car out and start living large!</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Avoid the hassle of finding a buyer</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your car is in really poor condition, it may be difficult to find a buyer on your own. Buyers may be hesitant to pay your asking price if many repairs need to be made, which can complicate the process.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 9 Essentials</span></h2>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Visibility equipment</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – We recommend reflective triangles or LED flares, safer than traditional flares, especially if children are around.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Water</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Have at least one gallon of water for each person.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Sunscreen</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Most dermatologists recommend an SPF 30 or higher sunscreen to protect again burning summer rays.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Reflective blanket</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Essential to provide shade if you’re stuck for a long period on the side of the highway. If necessary, a winter blanket can be used for shade.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>First aid kit</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – This item should be part of every emergency kit, summer or winter, and should include some ointment, bandages, gauze, adhesive tape and tweezers. And for those with life-threatening allergies, an EpiPen.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Small tool kit</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – You should also have this in your car the year around. Include an adjustable wrench, pliers, several screwdrivers and duct tape. A simple tool might help you get back on the road.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Flashlight</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – An LED flashlight is a good option for longer battery and bulb life.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Tire sealant</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – The sealant can repair holes in a tire tread up to ¼ inch in diameter.</span></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p lang="en-IN">As summer begins, we’re certain of a couple of things: first, everyone likes to save money, and second, cars are going to break down from time to time. So, to save money on repairs, always come to 3Brothers Garage for the very best selection of reliable, <a href="http://3brothersgarage.us/" title="Cheap Auto Parts In United States">cheap auto parts in United States</a>.</p>
<p lang="en-IN">We know that many people are itching to take a summer trip, and we don’t blame you! With winter weather on snooze, it may seem like driving hazards are too. However, summer driving has its own driving hazards to contend with. Here are a few safe summer driving tips to keep problems to a minimum.</p>
<h2 lang="en-IN">Engine check</h2>
<p lang="en-IN">Pop the hood and check the radiator pressure cap as well as all belts and hoses to make sure they’re in good shape with no blisters, cracks, or cuts in the rubber.</p>
<h2 lang="en-IN">Fluid check</h2>
<p lang="en-IN">Like you, your vehicle needs to stay hydrated. Check your coolant and windshield washer levels, and get your mechanic to check the fluid levels of your brakes, power steering, and automatic transmission.</p>
<h2 lang="en-IN">Tire check</h2>
<p lang="en-IN">Make sure all tires, including the spare, are inflated to the manufacturer’s specifications, found on your door jam. Look for any cracks, bulging, or breaks and check tire tread depth using a penny. Place a penny in several tread grooves over each tire. If you can always see the top of Lincoln’s head, it’s time to replace it.</p>
<h2 lang="en-IN">Battery check</h2>
<p lang="en-IN">The typical lifespan of your vehicle’s battery is 3-6 years, and if yours is 3 years old, get it checked before heading out.</p>
<h2 lang="en-IN">We Sell Cheap Auto Parts in United States</h2>
<p lang="en-IN">At a minimum, all these should be in good order before you hit the road.
