First, as we said in an earlier post, the prices of both new and used cars are skyrocketing with no leveling off in sight. Second, your car is not going to maintain itself, and if you want to keep it running well beyond the 100,000-mile mark, proper maintenance is essential.<\/p>\n<h2>5 Maintenance Basics<\/h2>\n<p>With those basic facts in mind, here are five tips anyone can follow to keep your current vehicle in top shape and operating safely and efficiently for thousands of miles to come.<\/p>\n<h3>Be familiar with the owner\u2019s manual<\/h3>\n<p>The owner\u2019s manual for your car contains a world of valuable information that far too many motorists ignore. Pay particular attention to the manufacturer&#8217;s recommended maintenance schedule and follow it. Following this schedule will help maximize the lifespan of your car while also avoiding unneeded repairs and replacements that some mechanics might try to talk you into.<\/p>\n<h3>Maintain your tires<\/h3>\n<p>Two things are essential when it comes to tire maintenance. First, check the tire pressure regularly and follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions on the proper pressure to maintain. Tires that are either under or over inflated can wear out much quicker than those in which the right pressure is maintained.<\/p>\n<p>Second, have your tires rotated every six months or every 6,000 to 8,000 miles. Rotating your tires means taking them off and putting them in a different position so that they wear evenly and last longer.<\/p>\n<h3>Change your motor oil regularly<\/h3>\n<p>OK, but what does \u201cregularly\u201d mean today? There was a time long ago when that meant having your oil changed every 1,000 miles or so, but that is no longer the case. Most of today\u2019s engines are built to need an oil change about every six months, or every 5,000 miles. <\/p>\n<p>However, if you drive in a lot of stop-and-go traffic, you might want to have it changed more frequently. And between changes, check your oil level periodically to spot potential problems like a leak that\u2019s causing the level to drop. Oil is absolutely essential to keep the moving parts of your car operating efficiently.<\/p>\n<h3>Check the coolant<\/h3>\n<p>Like oil, coolant is another essential fluid needed to prevent engine overheating and keep it operating efficiently. One of the last things you want is a slow leak that drains your coolant, leaving you with an overheated engine. So, periodically check beneath your car to see if there are any leaks and look under the radiator cap to make sure you have an adequate amount of coolant.<br \/>\n It\u2019s also a good idea to keep a supply of 50\/50 coolant on hand to put in the radiator when needed to avoid an overheated engine that leaves you stranded. <\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/www.aeroautoparts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1334\" height=\"787\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1320\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.aeroautoparts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/4.jpg 1334w, https:\/\/www.aeroautoparts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/4-300x177.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.aeroautoparts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/4-1024x604.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.aeroautoparts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/4-768x453.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1334px) 100vw, 1334px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Check your battery<\/h3>\n<p>The last thing you want is to be left stranded with a dead battery, and to avoid that, when you\u2019re getting the oil changed, ask your mechanic to check your battery. Today\u2019s batteries should last between 4 to 6 years, and if yours is in that age range, it\u2019s a good idea to replace it.<\/p>\n<h2>Used Car Parts in Chicago, IL<\/h2>\n<p>In addition to extending the life of your car by following these five basic tips, another way you can save money is by using used auto parts for repairs.
