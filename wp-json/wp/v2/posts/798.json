Everyone has a busy schedule, and keeping our cars clean can plainly and simply be too much of a hassle for a lot of us. But what if we told you keeping your car clean could be easy? It might be annoying, but if you just dedicate fifteen minutes out of your week to making sure your car is clean, you\u2019ll see a huge improvement! Your car should be your sanctuary\u2014your personal space. When it\u2019s messy, it can create a stressful environment. Get rid of that stress and ride in style with our easy-to-follow clean car tips below:<\/p>\n<h2>What Goes In Must Come Out<\/h2>\n<p>If you keep this mantra in the back of your mind every time you enter and exit your vehicle, you\u2019ll be shocked at the different it makes in the tidiness of your car. Whether it\u2019s your jacket, your bag, or that coffee mug, just remember\u2014if you take it into the car when you get in, take it out when you leave. This simple rule alleviates clutter and garbage from building up in your car.<\/p>\n<h2>Stay Organized<\/h2>\n<p>If there are some things that absolutely must stay in your car, at least keep them organized. Designate a place for everything so that it goes back in its place when you\u2019re done using it. A great tool for this is car organizers. You can buy these pretty cheap and they strap on snuggly to seat backs and blend seamlessly in with the interior of your vehicle. Keep that glove box organized with an accordion folder for all of your documents like your vehicle registration and owner\u2019s manual. If you want to get crazy, involve a label maker (it\u2019s actually pretty fun).<\/p>\n<h2>Get Rid of Dirt &#038; Grime<\/h2>\n<p>Wipe down all your surfaces with baby wipes you keep in the glove box. A quick wipe-down can make all the difference. Don\u2019t forget about those cup holders. Those pesky pockets are magnets for crumbs, dirt, and lint. Spend an extra second or two scrubbing your cup holders. Also\u2014don\u2019t ignore the carpets. Run the vacuum through your vehicle about once a month and you should be good to go.<\/p>\n<h2>Avoid Eating In the Car<\/h2>\n<p>Ok, this one might be tough\u2014but as much as you can, try not to eat in your car. Food wrappers, containers, and crumbs are the number one culprit for dirty interiors. If you eliminate the food, you eliminate the mess! (We know this one might be a stretch, but try your best).<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For a lot of us, when it comes to cleanliness, our vehicles tend to fall by the wayside.
