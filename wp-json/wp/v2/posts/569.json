Take an extra moment to scan the road.<br \/>\n\u2022 Motorcyclists often slow down by downshifting or letting off the throttle, which will not activate the brake light. Always increase your following distance when driving behind a motorcycle.<br \/>\n\u2022 Because of its small size, it may be difficult to judge a motorcycle\u2019s speed or to predict its ability to accelerate. It\u2019s safest to assume that a motorcycle is closure than you think.<br \/>\n\u2022 Motorcyclists often adjust position purposefully within a lane whether it\u2019s to be seen more easily and\/or to minimize the effects of road debris, passing vehicles, and wind.<br \/>\n\u2022 While a motorcycle is built to maneuver easily, car drivers should not assume that or expect a motorcyclist to be able to dodge out of the way.<br \/>\nUse these tips to make sharing the road with motorcyclists a safe and successful strategy! Consider that the person under the helmet is your friend, neighbor, or relative. Rather than driving aggressively, SHARE the road.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Did you know that over half of all fatal motorcycle crashes involve another vehicle?
