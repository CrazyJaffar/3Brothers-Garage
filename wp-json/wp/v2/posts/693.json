The countless outdoor activities, endless restaurants, and beautiful Lake Michigan make Chicago the place to be in the sunny months of summer. But drivers in Chicago know that summer doesn\u2019t come without at least a few issues\u2014especially for your vehicle. Not everyone has access to a garage, and leaving your car out in the heat can be problematic. Learn how to keep your car cool this summer with this tips!<\/p>\n<h2>Overheated Engine<\/h2>\n<p>Sweltering summer heat can cause problems for your engine. When the temperatures outside rise, the temperature gauge that measure\u2019s your engine\u2019s temperature rise too. High temperatures, warning lights, and steam coming from the hood are all signs of your engine overheating. If you see this happening, make sure to pull over immediately to let the engine cool down. Make sure that you always have enough coolant in your engine with regular maintenance, especially during the hot summer months.<\/p>\n<h2>Sun Damage<\/h2>\n<p>In the same way the sun has the potential to damage our skin, it can wreck your car\u2019s exterior and interior alike. Sun damage can ruin a car\u2019s paint job and discolor upholstery. It\u2019s important that whenever you can, park your car in a garage to prevent your car\u2019s body from getting sun damage. If you park in the sun, protect the inside of your car from sun damage by purchasing a sunshade to put behind your windshield. The sunshade will also help with the interior of your car from getting too hot. That way you can enter your car without burning your legs or hands.<\/p>\n<h2>Stinky Smells<\/h2>\n<p>We all know new car smell\u2014but what about hot car smell? The heat can make the interior of your car start to stink. Old-fashioned air fresheners can remedy this problem, but a simple trick to quick relief is putting a dryer sheet up against the air conditioner. Keep a box of dryer sheets in your console and every time you start up the A\/C, put one over the blower. Your car will start to smell a little less like it\u2019s melting, and a little more like it\u2019s fresh out of the lot!<br \/>\nStay tuned for more tips on car maintenance, auto parts, and driving on the <a href=\"http:\/\/aeroautoparts.com\/blog\" title=\"Aero Auto Parts blog\">Aero Auto Parts blog<\/a> and by following Aero Auto Parts on social media!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Summer in Chicago Summer in Chicago means long days at the beach, baseball games, and grilling on rooftop patios.
