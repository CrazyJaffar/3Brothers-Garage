If you usually drive in a school zone at these times, it is vital that you are aware &#8211; and extremely careful &#8211; of school kids on the street and sidewalk. From 2007 to 2011, nearly 1,700 children in Chicago ages 5-18 were struck by a vehicle within a block of school. Here is what you as a driver need to do to avoid such an accident.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be ready for the unexpected to happen, as children may run out into the street without thinking.<\/li>\n<li>Stop completely and properly at stop signs, crosswalks, and when behind a school bus.<\/li>\n<li>Follow the speed limit, as going faster makes it more difficult to stop abruptly if needed.<\/li>\n<li>Do not use your cell phone or other electronic devices &#8211; they are not only distract you from what is happening on the road, but are also illegal to use while driving in the state of Illinois.<\/li>\n<li>Make eye contact with pedestrians if possible, so you know they have seen you.<\/li>\n<li>Notice the lights on the school bus: yellow flashing means the bus is preparing to stop, and red means children are getting on or off the bus.<\/li>\n<li>Leave plenty of space between you and the bus.<\/li>\n<li>If you can, take a route to your destination that does not go through a school zone.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Look out for school children as you would want other drivers to look out for your own. Have a wonderful, safe school year!<br \/>\n&nbsp;<br \/>\n&nbsp;<br \/>\nCourtesy of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.edmunds.com\/car-safety\/driving-safely-in-school-zones.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Edmunds<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>School has begun, which means neighborhood streets are busy\u00a0with children walking or biking\u00a0to or from school\u00a0earlier in the morning and later in the afternoon.
