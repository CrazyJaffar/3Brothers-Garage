If you are the type of consumer that can afford to change to a new car every three years then you have not got a problem, any repairs or parts are covered by the manufacturer\u2019s new car warranty.<br \/>\nNot everyone has the luxury of buying a new car every few years, though. There are thousands of people that either must keep their older car because of economic concerns or have older cars as a hobby.<\/p>\n<h2>A few tips for buying cheap auto parts:<\/h2>\n<h3>Research:<\/h3>\n<p>Unless you are an expert, it is easy to confuse one part with another. When you source parts from a salvage yard, you need to know in advance exactly what part you need. If you can, it is always a good idea to take the old part with you, if not; you can usually research what you need online.<\/p>\n<h3>Investigate sources:<\/h3>\n<p>There are numerous sources for cheap auto parts. Check with others you know that also do their own car maintenance and repair, they can point you to the source that has always given them great service and great prices.<\/p>\n<h3>Check if there is an exchange policy:<\/h3>\n<p>When you buy used or reconditioned car parts there is always a risk, even though it may be slight. Check with the source to find out if they will replace a part that fails to perform. A good dealer will often have an exchange policy for parts that don\u2019t work.<\/p>\n<h3>Safety is paramount:<\/h3>\n<p>Some used car parts are not suitable for reuse. These are parts that are subject to a great deal of wear or may not be safe to use in the first place. Always think twice about the history of the part: There are times when buying cheap auto parts might not be the best thing to do.<br \/>\nIn the majority of cases buying used auto parts is fine. They will work as well as a new part and they will certainly save you a great deal of money!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As an automobile gets older, it will eventually need parts and service.
