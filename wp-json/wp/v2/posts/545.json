Car owners are celebrating by cleaning up their precious rides. The winter has been rough on our cars as you may notice salt build-up and discoloration on your tires and car body. Some of you may get a professional wash, while others will tackle this chore right in the driveway. Here are a few tips for finishing up your professional wash or for completing the job yourself.<br \/>\n<strong>The best car wash is a hand wash!<\/strong> Even though you drive through an auto car wash, it can miss spots on your car. Washing your car\u2019s body by hand or taking it to a hand washing service ensures that all the nooks and crannies have been addressed. This also allows you to spend extra time on exceptionally dirty areas of the car.<br \/>\n<strong>Timeliness!<\/strong> A new season is the perfect excuse to wash your auto. Tree sap, bird droppings, bugs, sun, grease, and dirt are all harmful elements that can corrode your vehicle and strip away wax and paint. It\u2019s important to wash these hazards off of your car. Location and climate are also two main factors that contribute to how often you need a wash. If there is heavy pollution in the air, consider washing a bit more often for example a few times a month. The same rule applies for the winter. You will need to wash your car more often to keep snow and salt away, but in the warmer months, once per month will suffice.<br \/>\n<strong>Best products to use!<\/strong> Household cleaning products and dish soaps can cause more harm than good. It\u2019s best to pick up a natural sponge, a non-abrasive cloth, and specially formulated car wash products that won\u2019t strip wax or paint. You may also want a separate rag for the tires since those can be especially dirty!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s springtime!
