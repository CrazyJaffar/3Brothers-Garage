They are a critical auto part on your vehicle. But how much do you really know about them? Do you know how they function? Do you know how they are maintained? Learn all about your car\u2019s brakes below.<\/p>\n<h2>How Brakes Work<\/h2>\n<p>Your cars brakes use fluid to transmit the force you apply on the brake pedal with your foot. Using hydraulics through a series of cylinders and pistons, the force of your foot on the brake pedal is amplified and that pressure is then applied to the wheels of the car. The pistons push two brake pads that apply pressure to either side of your car\u2019s tire and the friction between the pad and the tire slows the wheel\u2019s movement.<\/p>\n<h2>Maintaining Your Brakes<\/h2>\n<p>Several different things may affect how your brakes\u2019 function including temperature, road and weather conditions, and the level of maintenance performed on the brakes. In order to stay safe on the road, you\u2019ll want to keep your brakes in tip-top shape through routine up-keep. One of the most important things you can do to keep your brakes working properly is to change your brake fluid. Changing brake fluid is all-too-often an afterthought for vehicle owners. The truth is, though, that this is an easy solution that won\u2019t cost you much compared to the price of your brakes going out. You\u2019ll also want to get your brake pads checked and replaced when necessary.<\/p>\n<h2>Auto Parts in Chicago<\/h2>\n<p>If you are looking for new or used brakes, regardless of the make or model of your car, you\u2019ll want to head to Aero Auto Parts.
