You hear about all the new technologies like rear-view cameras, side airbags, onboard computers, and more. The one feature you don\u2019t hear about is glass.<br \/>\nBut innovations in auto glass have made cars much safer than they used to be. Regular glass, like the glass windows in your house or apartment, shatters when it breaks. Large shards burst in every direction.<br \/>\nYou could probably guess how dangerous it would be if your windshield shattered like a normal window. Those rocks and debris that usually bounce off\u2014sometimes without leaving a scratch\u2014would be a much bigger issue.<br \/>\nAnd accidents would be even more of a nightmare. Glass shards would be everywhere. So how is automotive glass different and how does it keep you safe?<br \/>\nAutomotive glass is made up of laminated glass and tempered glass. Both types have features that keep you safe from impact, but how they do that is different.<br \/>\nTempered Auto Glass<br \/>\nIn most cases, all the glass on your car except for the windshield is tempered. The glass created by a special system of cooling and heating. This process makes it so the glass can be pulled and pushed on without breaking. The process makes normal glass 5 to 10 times stronger.<br \/>\nLaminated Auto Glass<br \/>\nLaminated glass is a little different. This is the type of glass that windshields are made of. It\u2019s made by adding a layer of plastic between two pieces of glass. The plastic makes the glass shatter-resistant by providing a layer of cushioning.<br \/>\nIt also prevents the impact from breaking the glass into a thousand pieces of glass. This reduces the chance that you get severe cuts in an accident.<br \/>\nBut all these innovations won\u2019t do you much good if your windows or windshield are not installed by a trained auto glass professional.<br \/>\nThere are federal guidelines for how auto glass should be installed. So you should find an installer that you can trust, like Auto Glass Chicago.<br \/>\nAuto Glass Chicago offers auto glass services for the Chicago area.
