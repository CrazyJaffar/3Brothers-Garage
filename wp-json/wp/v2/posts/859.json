As this cool weather approaches and the leaves begin to change, it\u2019s important to make sure that your car is getting the attention it needs to perform its best. Here are a few things that you can do to prepare your car for the upcoming months.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Have the brakes and tires checked<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The best thing you can do to ensure your safety while driving in the fall and winter months is to make sure that your tires and brakes are functioning properly. You depend on your brakes and tires for sufficient stopping power in certain road conditions, so having a professional take a look at them before the weather gets too bad is key. If the tires show signs of significant wear, replace them. Have a professional test the brakes as well to ensure they won\u2019t give out on you when you need them most.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Replace the wiper blades<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Worn or damaged <a href=\"https:\/\/www.aeroautoparts.com\/blog\/changing-your-windshield-wiper-blades\" title=\"Changing Wiper Blades\">wiper blades<\/a> can be a serious hazard in the fall and winter months when the amount of rain and snowfall increases significantly. If your current wiper blades don\u2019t completely clear the windshield like they are designed to, we suggest you replace them.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Check the lights<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Walk around the outside of your car to make sure all headlights, taillights, parking lights, brake lights, and hazard lights are working. Replace any bulbs that aren\u2019t working and clean off your vehicle\u2019s lights as well to increase your visibility on the road.<strong> <\/strong><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Have the battery checked<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>When the weather gets cold, it takes your car a little extra effort to start the battery. Have a trained technician check your battery to make sure it is fully charged, or replace it if it is no longer sufficient.<\/p>\n<h2><strong> <\/strong><strong>Make sure heat and defrost work<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Working heat and defrost controls not only make your cold weather drives more comfortable, but they also help keep your car from fogging up. Inspect the front and rear defrosters to ensure they are working properly and won\u2019t leave you in the cold.<strong> <\/strong><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Change the oil<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Changing your car\u2019s oil never hurts. No matter the time of year, this will ensure that your vehicle is running efficiently.<br \/>\nCourtesy of Car Connection<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you live in the Chicago area, you know that the fall and winter weather can be iffy.
