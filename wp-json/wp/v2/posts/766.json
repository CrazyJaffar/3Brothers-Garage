Below, you\u2019ll learn everything you need to know about your car\u2019s radiator, how it functions, what can go wrong, and what you can do when yours breaks.<\/p>\n<h2>Function<\/h2>\n<p>In short, your vehicle\u2019s radiator prevents the engine from overheating. When the engine runs, it produces a lot of friction, and in turn, heat. The radiator uses coolant to keep the engine cool so that it can run smoothly. It feeds coolant, such as water or antifreeze, to the engine through channels. Keeping coolant at appropriate levels is essential for proper function of the radiator.<\/p>\n<h2>Malfunction<\/h2>\n<p>There are a variety of things that can go wrong with your car\u2019s radiator causing you to need either a repair or a replacement. Below are some of the most common problems that your vehicle\u2019s radiator might have.<br \/>\n\u2022 <strong>Thermostat<\/strong>: Sometimes your car\u2019s thermostat can fail, which can cause your radiator to malfunction. When the thermostat tells the radiator the wrong temperature, the radiator sends the incorrect amount of fluid to cool the engine down. If the thermostat is underreporting the temperature, the radiator will not send enough fluid, and the engine will quickly overheat.<br \/>\n\u2022 <strong>Hoses<\/strong>: The hoses that transport coolant may break or leak. When a hose leaks, it hinders the transfer of coolant from the radiator to the engine, making the engine overheat. These hoses should be checked and replaced relatively frequently to ensure optimal flow of coolant.<br \/>\n\u2022 <strong>Fan<\/strong>: Many cars nowadays have electric fans which keep the car cool. This fan can become obstructed or stop working and can cause your car to overheat.<br \/>\n\u2022 <strong>Water Pump<\/strong>: Your radiator uses a pump to move coolant throughout the engine. When the radiator\u2019s water pump is broken, it can cause the flow of coolant to slow or stop.<\/p>\n<h2>Finding A New Radiator<\/h2>\n<p>If your car\u2019s radiator breaks, you have a few options. The first is getting it repaired. Take it into a garage and see if repairs are an option. If not, you might be looking at a replacement.
