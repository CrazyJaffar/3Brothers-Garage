There may be some scrap yards in the area that will buy a <a href=\"http:\/\/aeroautoparts.com\/chicago-il-junk-car-services\" title=\"Junk Car Chicago\">Chicago junk car<\/a> without a title, but there is a significant risk in doing this, and we choose to follow state and federal laws with regards to title transfers. Having the title protects the vehicle owner, as it cannot be sold by a third-party. Additionally, with the title transferred to us, the owners can cancel their registration and insurance.\n<\/p>\n<h2>How to Get a Title<br \/>\n<\/h2>\n<p>Most people purchase a car and simply place the title in a folder in their filing cabinet or storage area with any other paperwork that came with the vehicle. If you have used the vehicle as collateral for a loan, the bank may have the title in your file in their records, and it may not have been sent back to you after the loan was repaid. It may also be in the glove box if it was placed there at the time of purchase.\n<\/p>\n<p>In the event you cannot find the title, you can apply for a duplicate title from the Illinois Secretary of State office. This does take a bit of time, so check for the title early if you are considering selling a Chicago junk car.\n<\/p>\n<h2>Call Us at Aero Auto Parts<br \/>\n<\/h2>\n<p>Once you find the original title or have a duplicate issued and in your hands, call 773-482-3882 and talk to a representative at Aero Auto Parts. We can come to your location, price your Chicago junk car, pay you immediately, and haul it away.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The simple answer to the question of selling a car without a title at Aero Auto Parts is that it cannot be done; we require a title.
