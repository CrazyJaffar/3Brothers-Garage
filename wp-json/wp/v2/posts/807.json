Check The Alignment!"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Your vehicle\u2019s alignment is one of the most important aspects of your vehicle\u2019s proper function, and unfortunately is also often one of the most overlooked. A lot of people just think that \u201cthat\u2019s the way their car is\u201d. But make no mistake: poor alignment is a problem that should be fixed and can be relatively easily. Below are some of the most common symptoms that indicate your car\u2019s alignment is out of whack.<\/p>\n<h2>The Steering Wheel Is Crooked<\/h2>\n<p>If you are driving down a straight, flat road, your steering wheel should be centered. If your steering wheel leans to one side without you turning it, you\u2019ve probably got an alignment problem on your hands. Likewise, your steering wheel should return to its center position naturally after you complete a turn. As you continue to drive, the wheel should straighten out on its own.<\/p>\n<h2>The Vehicle Pulls One Way<\/h2>\n<p>If you notice while you\u2019re driving that your vehicle pulls to either the left or the right, it could be your alignment. Every road is different and most have some sort of curve or slope to them, so some pull is normal on most roads. However, when you notice consistently that your vehicle pulls to one side or the other, it\u2019s time to get that alignment checked &#038; corrected.<\/p>\n<h2>Tire Wear<\/h2>\n<p>Your tires may be affected unevenly due to an alignment issue. If your vehicle\u2019s alignment is off in favor of one direction or the other, one side of tires will have more stress put on them, causing wear patterns to show up differently. Usually, a mechanic would notice this sort of thing during a tire rotation. It\u2019s important to have proper alignment because it can actually increase the lifespan of your tires.<\/p>\n<h2>Loose Handling<\/h2>\n<p>Wheel misalignment can also cause the handling of your vehicle to feel off or loose. If you\u2019re driving along and you feel your vehicle swaying and drifting all over the road, taking sloppy turns, or not responding to steering wheel movements, you need to go in and get that alignment checked!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Your vehicle\u2019s alignment is one of the most important aspects of your vehicle\u2019s proper function, and unfortunately is also often one of the most overlooked.
