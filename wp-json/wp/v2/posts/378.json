Whether you want to believe it,\u00a0<em>you\u00a0<\/em>may be causing your own road rage. By using safe driving practices, you can keep yourself and others on the road calm, and more importantly, safe.<br \/>\n<strong>Don&#8217;t Get Distracted<br \/>\n<\/strong>It is easy to get distracted while driving, but paying attention is incredibly important! Losing focus for even a split second could put yourself and all other drivers in danger. Keep the task at hand &#8211; driving &#8211; a priority. Whatever else you have to do, it can wait.<br \/>\n<strong>Don&#8217;t Rush<br \/>\n<\/strong>What are you accomplishing by speeding? Being late to your destination isn&#8217;t the worst thing in the world, especially if it means keeping people safe.<br \/>\n<strong>Don&#8217;t Tailgate<br \/>\n<\/strong>Keep a distance of about two seconds between you and the car in front of you. Again, what is tailgating accomplishing? In many cases, the person in that car will get annoyed and may slow down even more. Patience is a virtue; keep calm and give the vehicle some space.<br \/>\n<strong>Don&#8217;t Drive if You are Tired<br \/>\n<\/strong>Overly fatigued drivers cause more than 100,000 accidents each year, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. You may think you will be fine, but sleepiness causes delayed reactions. Get some sleep before hitting the road.<br \/>\n<strong>Don&#8217;t Hold a Grudge<br \/>\n<\/strong>If a driver in front of, behind or next to you does something that annoys you, let it go. Everyone makes mistakes, and laying on the horn or offensive gestures will only make things worse for you and other travelers.<br \/>\nAre you an offender of any of these driving no-nos? Try to change up your driving style and you (and any passengers in your car) will be much happier.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<br \/>\n&nbsp;<br \/>\nCourtesy of CarTalk<br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.cartalk.com\/content\/official-car-talk-guide-civil-driving\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http:\/\/www.cartalk.com\/content\/official-car-talk-guide-civil-driving<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Do you get frustrated with others on the road?
