One way of accomplishing this is through proper maintenance of your vehicle\u2019s cooling system. This important system keeps you comfortable in the passenger cabin while also keeping your engine running smoothly while preventing it from overheating.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1311\" src=\"http:\/\/www.aeroautoparts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/image8.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"612\" height=\"367\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.aeroautoparts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/image8.png 612w, https:\/\/www.aeroautoparts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/image8-300x180.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px\" \/><\/p>\n<p lang=\"en-IN\" align=\"justify\">While proper maintenance of your vehicle\u2019s cooling system is extremely important, about 28% of the vehicles on America\u2019s roads are operating with inadequate maintenance and protection. If you can\u2019t remember the last time you had your vehicle\u2019s radiator flushed and the coolant replaced, your vehicle falls into this category. It is likely time for you to pay a bit more attention to your vehicle\u2019s cooling system &#8211; and we\u2019ll tell you why.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How the Cooling System Works<\/h2>\n<p lang=\"en-IN\" align=\"justify\">Your vehicle\u2019s cooling system is designed to cool your engine while it is running, and it is a circulating process that begins in the radiator. Stated simply, coolant travels from the radiator, then circulates through the engine while drawing away engine heat. The coolant then returns to the radiator where the fan and air flowing through the fins of the radiator reduces the temperature of the coolant. It then returns to the engine once again, and thus, continues the cooling cycle.<\/p>\n<p lang=\"en-IN\" align=\"justify\">The coolant is designed to protect the running engine from overheating, and it also protects vital parts in the cooling system against corrosion. When the coolant gets old, it cannot do its job properly, and you run the risk of repeatedly overheating your engine which can lead to extensive and expensive repairs..<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Signs of a Cooling System Problem<\/h2>\n<p lang=\"en-IN\">Here are some things to watch for that may indicate you have a problem with your cooling system.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Engine Overheating<\/strong> \u2013 Any number of things can cause your engine to overheat &#8211; like a broken water pump or a broken belt &#8211; to name two. If your engine\u2019s temperature warning light comes on, it\u2019s best to either pull over and call for a tow, or let it cool completely and add a 50\/50 antifreeze mixture to fill the radiator and cautiously make your way to the repair shop. Continuing to drive while the engine is overheated could lead to permanent engine damage.<\/li>\n<li><strong>The Smell of Antifreeze<\/strong> \u2013 The smell of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.aeroautoparts.com\/blog\/the-importance-of-antifreeze\/\" title=\"The Importance Of Antifreeze\">antifreeze<\/a> when driving or right after you\u2019ve stopped your vehicle indicates a leak in the system, often indicating that antifreeze is dripping onto your hot engine or leaking into the passenger compartment due to a faulty heater core. This problem requires immediate attention.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Antifreeze<\/strong> on the Ground \u2013 A puddle of coolant under your vehicle is another indication of a leak that prevents the cooling system from protecting your engine against overheating.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Coolant Level is Perpetually Low<\/strong> \u2013 Having to add coolant regularly is still another sign of a leak in the cooling system.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cooling System Maintenance<\/h2>\n<p lang=\"en-IN\">At Aero Auto Parts, the home of high-quality, cheap auto parts in Illinois, we have a few tips we think might be helpful to properly maintain your vehicle\u2019s cooling system.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Check the radiator, belts and hoses regularly and have them replaced when they begin to show signs of wear.<\/li>\n<li>Replace the drive belt \u2013 also known as the serpentine belt \u2013 if it is beginning to show any signs of wear. Check your owner\u2019s manual for replacement information or ask your mechanic for his opinion.<\/li>\n<li>Have the cooling system properly serviced. At least once every two years the old fluid should be drained, the system flushed, and new coolant added.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p lang=\"en-IN\">Have the cooling system properly serviced.
