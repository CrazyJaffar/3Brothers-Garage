And unfortunately for Chicago, the Illinois Department of Transportation\u2019s report on crash facts and statistics said <a href=\"http:\/\/www.idot.illinois.gov\/Assets\/uploads\/files\/Transportation-System\/Resources\/Safety\/Crash-Reports\/crash-facts\/2014%20CF.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">accidents were on the rise<\/a>.<br \/>\nWith more people on the streets every day accidents aren\u2019t going away. Luckily, auto parts dealers in Chicago always have seatbelts in stock. So if your belts are damaged or missing, it won\u2019t be hard to find replacements. But how do these life-saving devices work?<\/p>\n<h2>How Do Seatbelts Help?<\/h2>\n<p>Remaining secure inside your car often means the difference between walking away from a crash and serious injury or death.<br \/>\nSeatbelts stop you from flying out of the vehicle in an accident. They\u2019re also designed to spread the force of a crash to the strongest parts of your body\u2014your pelvis and ribcage.<br \/>\nIn a high-speed crash, however, even seatbelts can injure you. That\u2019s why they have special stitching in the belt that will rip slightly to allow for a little more give when the belt is stretched far enough. This feature is called a load limiter.<\/p>\n<h2>How Do Seatbelts Work?<\/h2>\n<p>You\u2019ll notice that you can move around freely with your seatbelt on. That\u2019s because the seatbelt is attached to a spool which will unwind when you pull on the belt.<br \/>\nWhen a crash occurs though, the belt locks up and pulls your body into the perfect crash position. This is accomplished through a pretensioner which is a device that\u2019s only activated when the car detects impact.<\/p>\n<h2>Chicago Auto Parts<\/h2>\n<p>The seatbelt system is inexpensive when you think of how vital it is to your safety. If your car is missing seatbelts or you think they might need replacing, you should visit a Chicago auto parts dealer.<br \/>\nFor the best parts in Chicago, look no further than Aero Auto Parts.
