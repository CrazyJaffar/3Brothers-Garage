If you ever talked to someone with a manual car, they\u2019ll tell you how much it\u2019s better than automatics.<\/p>\n<p>But what exactly makes them so great? If you\u2019re considering a manual transmission vehicle, here are some pros and cons of stick shift to know.<\/p>\n<h2>Advantages of Manual Transmission<\/h2>\n<p>Anyone who can drive a stick shift already knows how fun it is to get behind the wheel. There are many other benefits of driving a stick shift car that newcomers can appreciate:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cheaper to Maintain<\/strong>: Manual cars are typically cheaper to maintain than automatics because they use fewer parts and components. Automatic transmission vehicles have more electronics and moving parts. Keep in mind that aggressive driving styles in a manual will result in costly repairs.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Less Distractions<\/strong>: Another significant benefit of a manual transmission is less distracted driving. Since you control the car\u2019s gear switch, you won\u2019t have a free hand to text or fidget with the radio. Fewer distractions mean safer driving wherever you go.<\/li>\n<li><strong>More Fun and Control<\/strong>: When driving a stick shift, you feel more in touch with the acceleration, handling, braking, and engine. Basically, you can use the car to its full potential with more hands-on control involved.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Better Resale Value<\/strong>: The resale value on sportier manuals is typically better than the automatic versions.<\/li>\n<li><strong>You Join a Tight-Knit Community<\/strong>: Manual car owners appreciate the mechanics, performance, and resale value of their vehicles. Once you own one, you join that small, but tight-knit, community.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/www.aeroautoparts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/Disadvantages-of-Manual-Transmission.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Disadvantages of Manual Transmission<\/h2>\n<p>Of course, there are some disadvantages to driving stick you should know too:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Learning Curve<\/strong>: When learning how to drive a manual car, don\u2019t be surprised if you stall, jerk, and miss gear changes. It takes time learning how to properly shift gears, brake, depress the clutch, and accelerate. There\u2019s more of a learning curve with driving manuals than with automatic or continuously variable transmissions (CVT).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Greater Difficulty Parking Uphill<\/strong>: Parking on a hill is nightmarish in any car if you\u2019re new to the experience. However, manual cars roll back more than automatics, which is terrifying when driving on an incline with oncoming traffic below.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Clutch Pain<\/strong>: The clutch pedal becomes your best friend as you control the car. As a result, you can expect new leg pain to develop over time, especially around the joints, as you depress the clutch with each gear switch.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Tiresome Driving in Heavy Traffic<\/strong>: Given these, driving manuals can feel like a chore. Automatic transmissions do everything for you, making them easier to drive. While most manual drivers understand the work involved, the constant focus on mechanics and pedaling deters some drivers.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Hard to Find\/Limited Selection<\/strong>: Manuals are a dying breed. Most auto manufacturers are now <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gearpatrol.com\/cars\/a42009174\/manual-transmission-dying\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">discontinuing manuals<\/a> in favor of automatics and CVTs. That means there is a dwindling selection of stick shift vehicles left, making them harder to find.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Driving manual transmission vehicles takes time and patience. If you are in the process of deciding which transmission to choose, weigh these advantages and disadvantages.<\/p>\n<h2>Shop Manual Parts Today!<\/h2>\n<p>If you do drive a manual transmission and need extra parts for repairs or custom restoration, check out our selection of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.aeroautoparts.com\/chicago-il-used-auto-parts\/\">used auto parts<\/a>!
