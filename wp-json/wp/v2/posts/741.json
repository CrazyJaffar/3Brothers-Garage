You lose control of steering, and the car begins to bounce up and down rapidly. Desperately, you attempt to make it to the road\u2019s shoulder and come to a stop. You have blown a tire. So what do you do? First and foremost, consult your vehicle\u2019s owner\u2019s manual\u2014but for most vehicles, you can follow these steps.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Get Somewhere Safe<\/h2>\n<p>The most important thing in this situation is your safety. When you realize that you have a blown tire, you\u2019ll want to slowly and calmly get to the safest place you can\u2014whether that be the shoulder of the road or a driveway, or a parking lot. Avoid hills, curves in roads, and narrow shoulders if at all possible. Do not expose yourself to oncoming traffic when changing a tire. Turn on your hazard lights as soon as you can to alert other drivers of your situation.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Prepare Your Vehicle<\/h2>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve reached a safe location to change your tire, you\u2019ll have to prepare your vehicle to change the tire. You\u2019ll need to use the parking break so that the vehicle doesn\u2019t roll. If you have wheel wedges, you\u2019ll want to put them in front of or behind the tires you aren\u2019t changing to help ensure the vehicle won\u2019t roll. Next, remove the hubcap or wheel cover (if there is one)<\/p>\n<h2>3. Loosen Lug Nuts<\/h2>\n<p>The next step will be taking a wrench and loosening the lug nuts that are keeping the current wheel in place. Turning them counterclockwise will loosen them. It might be difficult, so don\u2019t get discouraged if you can\u2019t get them to budge right away. Don\u2019t completely take them off yet, though!<\/p>\n<h2>4. Jack It Up<\/h2>\n<p>Place the jack under the vehicle. You\u2019ll want to consult the owner\u2019s manual to find out exactly where to place the jack, as every vehicle is a little bit different. Once the jack is positioned correctly, use it to raise the vehicle off the ground. You only have to raise it about six inches off the ground. As we said before, your safety is the number one priority here, so don\u2019t ever put any body part under the vehicle at any point during this process.<\/p>\n<h2>5. Remove The Flat<\/h2>\n<p>Unscrew the lug nuts you loosened earlier and place them somewhere you won\u2019t lose them. Then gently pull the tire off of the hub and put it off to the side.<\/p>\n<h2>6. Replace With Spare<\/h2>\n<p>Take your spare tire and place it on the lug bolts. Push until the tire is securely in place. Next, take those lug nuts and put them back on their bolts. Tighten them as much as you can by hand. Don\u2019t worry about getting the wrench out again until after you lower the vehicle off of the jack.<\/p>\n<h2>7. Lower The Vehicle<\/h2>\n<p>Lower the vehicle so that the tire is resting on the ground, but not so much that the entire weight of the car is on the tire. Tighten the lug nuts as much as you can with the wrench and then lower the vehicle the rest of the way. If you have a hubcap or wheel cover, now will be the time to put it back on, and stow all the equipment you used away.<\/p>\n<h2>8. Check the Pressure<\/h2>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve successfully affixed the spare tire to the vehicle, you\u2019ll want to check the tire pressure. Spares often require about 60 PSI in tire pressure. If your spare is less than this, you\u2019ll want to drive with extra caution while making your way to the closest shop.<\/p>\n<h2>9. Bring The Vehicle In<\/h2>\n<p>You\u2019ll want to carefully drive to the closest repair shop you can find. Spare tires are not designed to be permanent solutions to a flat or drive for long distances or at high speeds. You\u2019ll want to get your car into a service station and get the problem fixed as soon as possible. Again\u2014drive carefully, especially if tire pressure is less-than-ideal.<\/p>\n<h2>10. Prevent Future Blowouts<\/h2>\n<p>Learn from this experience: do all you can to avoid having a flat tire in the future. You can prevent this situation by keeping up on proper vehicle maintenance, rotating your tires, making sure they have the correct tire pressure and tread, and driving carefully. There\u2019s no way to fully prevent a flat tire, but these tips can help.<\/p>\n<h3>Auto Parts in Chicago<\/h3>\n<p>A flat tire is one of the most common vehicle problems that can happen\u2014but they\u2019re certainly not the only thing that can go wrong.
