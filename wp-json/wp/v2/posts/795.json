When your car\u2019s tires are underinflated, it means that you have less control over the vehicle. It also means that the tires are more likely to pop. This makes driving significantly more dangerous. Underinflated tires also increase the wear on your tires, which means you\u2019ll need new tires sooner (an avoidable cost). They also waste gas because your vehicle isn\u2019t running efficiently. For all these reasons and more, it\u2019s important to check your tire pressure and inflate your tires to a proper level about once every month. You can\u2019t always tell if a tire is underinflated just by looking at it, so you\u2019ll want to take these measures to check\u2026<\/p>\n<h2>Buy A Tire Gauge<\/h2>\n<p>Buying a tire gauge to keep in your car is going to be the most hassle-free means of keeping up on your tire pressure. Usually, they don\u2019t cost more than about $10. If you\u2019re feeling ambitious, pair it with a notebook to record each time you check the pressure.<\/p>\n<h2>Figure Out The Right Pressure<\/h2>\n<p>There are a few places you can look to find the correct level of tire pressure for you vehicle. You can look in the owner\u2019s manual, find it online, or look on the sticker that is inside the driver\u2019s side door. Look carefully, as some vehicles require different levels of pressure for the front and back tires.<\/p>\n<h2>Check Pressure In The Morning<\/h2>\n<p>Checking your tire pressure in the morning is important because you\u2019ll want to check when the tires are cold. When you drive your car, tires heat up, causing the pressure to differ from when they are cold. All of the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations for tire pressure are measured while tires are cold. This is why you want to check before you\u2019ve started driving your car.<\/p>\n<h2>Checking The Pressure<\/h2>\n<p>First unscrew the valve cap and put it somewhere that you won\u2019t lose it (you\u2019d be surprised how easily those disappear). You\u2019ll want to press the tire gauge you bought onto the valve stem. When you do this, a reading will appear on the tire gauge. Compare this with what the manufacturer recommends.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Making sure that your car\u2019s tires are properly inflated is crucial to your safety.
