Commonly, lots scrap them for parts, metal, and wiring. But who buys these used auto parts, and why?<\/p>\n<p>Finding and buying parts at a junkyard saves more money than ordering through a dealership or independent seller. Additionally, some car owners own a specific model where finding parts is challenging. From DIY car repairs to auto shop classes, here are the primary buyers of used car parts.<\/p>\n<h2>DIY Car Repair<\/h2>\n<p>Many people shop at auto salvage yards to find replacement parts for their specific vehicles. Most car owners take their cars to a mechanic for service, but some like to get dirty with their car repairs. It is often more cost-efficient to visit a junkyard than buying through independent sellers, auto shops, or dealerships.<\/p>\n<p>Finding specific parts is also challenging if the car owner has a unique vehicle, like an import. Junkyards have a vast assortment of domestic and foreign parts and components that are hard to find elsewhere.<\/p>\n<h2>Car Restoration Enthusiasts<\/h2>\n<p>When you visit an auto show, it\u2019s impressive to see the old models of yesteryear. Yet, these cars don\u2019t come prebuilt. Most often, devoted car enthusiasts spend the skills, time, and patience restoring these cars to their former glory. Therefore, these restoration projects require specific engines, transmissions, and other car parts only found at salvage yards.<\/p>\n<h2>Auto Shops and Schools<\/h2>\n<p>Some auto shops purchase salvage yard car parts for their high quality and low cost. They can also order wholesale to restock their inventories.<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, high schools and colleges with auto shop classes purchase salvage cars and independent components for class projects. Students gain hands-on practice, improving their skills in auto repair.<\/p>\n<h2>Where to Find Used Auto Parts?<\/h2>\n<p>The best place to find used car parts in Chicago, IL, is at Aero Auto Parts.
