Although a highly intricate and complex mechanism, understanding the basics of how your car\u2019s engine works doesn\u2019t have to be so hard. Simply put, the point of your car\u2019s engine is to take fuel\u2014i.e. gasoline\u2014and convert that fuel into motion.  The gasoline is burned internally, which is where the name \u201cinternal combustion engine\u201d comes from. It then emits exhaust and emissions. Of course there are several types of engines that vary in how they operate and what types of fuel they use, but we will focus on the basics.<\/p>\n<h2>How Internal Combustion Works<\/h2>\n<p>When fuel is ignited in a small, enclosed space, gas expands to create a blast of energy. In an engine, the energy created from internal combustion moves small devices called pistons which are located in an engine\u2019s cylinders. Cylinders are the enclosures within an engine in which pistons move up and down. Generally speaking, the higher number of cylinders in an engine, the more power is created because more pistons are working to create energy. These pistons turn another device called a crankshaft which creates circular motion.<\/p>\n<h2>Multi-Cylinder Engines<\/h2>\n<p>There are a number of different configurations and cylinder quantities that have their own unique pros and cons. Depending on the arrangement, an engine may perform better, cost less to manufacture, or be shaped differently. More often than not, cars have either 4, 6, or 8 cylinders. Some are arranged in line with each other, some are flat, and some are in a \u201cV\u201d shape. There are some perfectly efficient four-cylinder engines just as there are less efficient eight-cylinder engines.<\/p>\n<h2>How Your Engine Starts<\/h2>\n<p>Turning your car key causes a motor to spin which starts the combustion process. This motor is very powerful and requires a lot of electricity to get going. A large electronic device called a solenoid helps generate the power needed to spin the motor and begin combustion.<\/p>\n<h2>Engine Cooling<\/h2>\n<p>Your car\u2019s engine needs to be cooled by either water which circulates around the cylinders and through a radiator or by air which flows through an air filter and directly into the cylinders. Air needs to be circulated through the engine, and is sometimes pressurized in high-performance engines.<\/p>\n<h2>Chicago Auto Parts<\/h2>\n<p>If you are looking for auto parts, and an engine is on your shopping list, look no further than <a href=\"http:\/\/aeroautoparts.com\/\" title=\"Aero Auto Parts\">Aero Auto Parts<\/a>.
