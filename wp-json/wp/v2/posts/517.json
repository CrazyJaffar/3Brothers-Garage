Deciding between using new or old auto parts is something that most backyard mechanics go through since they may be looking for cheaper alternatives, but do not want to jeopardize the safety or long term reliability of the vehicle.

There are also other used parts you may consider; however, you must pay particular attention to their condition. A few example of parts of this nature are cylinder heads, the fuel pump, the radiator, and the transmission. You want to be sure that these parts have not been damaged or are unserviceable. Never buy old brake shoes, clutch plates, or pistons since these parts take a great deal of abuse in use and should always be purchased new.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size:13px; padding-top:0;\">Buy Used From Aero <\/h2>\n<p>Our auto salvage yard has an enormous supply of used auto parts for almost all makes and models.
