Antifreeze is a fluid substance made specifically to keep this system functioning properly. Without antifreeze, also known as coolant, your car&#8217;s engine would suffer irreparable damage.<br \/>\nIt is especially important to keep on your car&#8217;s antifreeze levels during times of extreme heat or cold. If the temperature outside is on the rise or dropping dramatically, your car&#8217;s engine will need antifreeze to protect it from the extreme temperatures.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size:14px;\">Proper Combination<\/h2>\n<p>Some people may wonder why water cannot be used to keep a car&#8217;s radiator functioning properly. Well, unlike water, antifreeze does not turn into ice and it protects your engine against overheating, rust, and corrosion. In certain circumstances, water may be a sufficient coolant for a short period of time, but eventually the heat of an engine will cause the water to evaporate. If water is used as a substitute for antifreeze during the winter months, it will freeze and cause significant damage when the temperature drops below thirty-two degrees.<br \/>\nAntifreeze alone is not safe to use in your car either. This is because the freezing temperature of antifreeze will not be lowered sufficiently to protect your car unless it is mixed with water. Pure antifreeze does not have the same heat-transfer capabilities as antifreeze mixed with water. This combination will also help prevent corrosion much better than antifreeze alone.<br \/>\nThe combination most people suggest when adding antifreeze to your car is fifty\/fifty; half water, half antifreeze. These measurements will protect your car&#8217;s engine and the antifreeze will lower the water&#8217;s freezing point and extend the boiling point. You can usually buy this pre-mixed or in concentrate and dilute it yourself; just remember, it is always best to use distilled water. Tap water often contains a host of minerals which can cause corrosion and create mineral deposits in your engine.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In order for a car to run properly it must have an adequate cooling system which protects the engine against overheating.
