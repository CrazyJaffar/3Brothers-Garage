That was the year when William Durant, who earlier had helped found General Motors, teamed up with Swiss engineer and race driver Louis Chevrolet to found Chevrolet Motor Company in Michigan.<\/p>\n<p>Chevrolet\u2019s production of cars began in 1912, and believe it or not, Chevy actually offered customers its first V8 engine in 1917, the year the company also built its first truck models. Those early V8s were only manufactured for a couple of years, however, when Chevy began turning out 4- and 6-cylinder engines. After that, it wasn&#8217;t until 1955 that Chevys with V8 engines again began rolling off the company\u2019s assembly lines.<\/p>\n<h2>Chevy Before and During World War II<\/h2>\n<p>During the 1920s the popularity of Chevrolet cars and trucks consistently increased and new plants were built to keep up with consumer demand. Like other manufacturers, Chevy was hit hard by the stock market crash and depression of 1929, but gradually rebounded in the 1930s.<\/p>\n<p>The 30s saw the introduction of the Chevy Sports Sedan, its first model with a built-in trunk, and in 1934, the 10 millionth Chevrolet was driven off the company\u2019s assembly lines. <\/p>\n<p>Like virtually every other company of any size, during World War II Chevrolet factories turned out huge qualities of equipment needed by our armed forces and those of our allies. Chevy factories during the war produced things like aircraft engines and parts, military ambulances and armored cars, gun parts, and an estimated 120 million rounds of artillery ammunition.<\/p>\n<h2>Prosperity in the PostWar Period and Beyond<\/h2>\n<p>Following the end of the war in 1945, Chevy quickly retooled and returned to its normal production of cars and trucks for the general public. The first Bel Air models were produced in 1950, along with the power glide automatic transmission. <\/p>\n<p>Then in 1953 the first soon-to-be classic Corvette was produced, while Chevy reintroduced models with V8 engines in 1955, and of course, there was the 1957 Chevy that became an almost instant classic with its distinctive fins. <\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/www.aeroautoparts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/chevrolet-used.jpg\" alt=\"Chevrolet Used Auto Parts in Chicago\" width=\"1333\" height=\"787\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1339\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.aeroautoparts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/chevrolet-used.jpg 1333w, https:\/\/www.aeroautoparts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/chevrolet-used-300x177.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.aeroautoparts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/chevrolet-used-1024x605.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.aeroautoparts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/chevrolet-used-768x453.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1333px) 100vw, 1333px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Over the next decades, Chevrolet continued to innovate and produce ever popular cars and trucks, including ground breaking electric models in 2023.<\/p>\n<h2>Chevy Used Parts in Chicago<\/h2>\n<p>To be quite honest, if you\u2019re looking for parts for that 1917 Chevy V8, the chances are pretty good we don\u2019t have them.
