Without either, your car simply won\u2019t run. Chicagoland lends itself to all sorts of hazards to the longevity of your engine and transmission. City driving, poor roadways, and the changing seasons all have an effect on the inner workings of your car or truck. Below you\u2019ll learn why these\u00a0<a title=\"Cheap Auto Parts In Chicago, IL\" href=\"\/\">auto parts<\/a>\u00a0in particular are so important and some of the most common problems drivers encounter with them.<\/p>\n<h2>Engine<\/h2>\n<p>Think of the engine of your vehicle as its heart. The engine takes the gasoline you put into your fuel tank and converts it into energy which gets the wheels turning. It does this using internal combustion. However, there are several things that can hinder a car\u2019s engine from burning fuel efficiently and creating this motion. Your engine may fail to start, you may see the temperature climb to a dangerous level, or you\u2019ll see the \u201ccheck engine\u201d light turn on. There are many reasons for these things happening, and by taking your car into the shop, a trained mechanic can diagnose the problem and fix it. We cure any and all problems with your engine from dirty air filters to broken cooling fans or blown had gaskets.<\/p>\n<h2>Transmission<\/h2>\n<p>Your vehicle\u2019s transmission is a mechanical system that changes the gear of your vehicle. Basically, it helps apply different levels of power from the engine. It is an intricate and complex system with many moving parts. Because of the high number of components and constant use, it is subject to a lot of wear and tear. You cannot drive without a transmission, and so it is incredibly important to keep yours maintained and to keep up on this wear and tear. If you notice unusual sounds or other problems with your transmission, it will be crucial to take your vehicle in to get professional service.<\/p>\n<h2>Repair<\/h2>\n<p>Often times, engine and transmission problems can be repaired by a professional mechanic. Things like dirty air filters, hoses, or low fluid levels are easier fixes compared to alternative issues. Repairs are often less expensive than installations and replacements, so it is a good idea to come in to the garage at the first sign of a problem. Usually, if caught early enough, issues can be repaired and you can avoid a costly replacement.<\/p>\n<h2>Installation &amp; Replacement<\/h2>\n<p>Sometimes, an engine or transmission becomes so badly damaged that it cannot be repaired. This is especially common for older models. When this is the case, we can provide installation for replacement engines or transmissions for your vehicle.
