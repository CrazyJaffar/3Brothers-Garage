For example, it\u2019s estimated that in 2021, despite a worldwide pandemic, Ford sold about 3.9 million vehicles across the globe.<\/p>\n<h2>Ford, a brief history of the company<\/h2>\n<p>Company founder Henry Ford put his first motorized vehicle together in 1897. It was a simple contraption known as a quadricycle, powered by a four-horsepower engine, riding on bicycle tires, and guided by a tiller rather than a steering wheel. And for good measure, the thing had only two forward gears and no reverse gear at all!<\/p>\n<p>From that humble beginning, with the backing of 12 investors and the whopping sum of $28,000, Ford founded the Ford Motor Company in 1903. Ford proved to be a restless innovator, and as early as 1908 he began putting the nation on gas-powered wheels with the introduction of the Model T Ford.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/www.aeroautoparts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/ford-and-used-ford-auto-parts-in-chicago-il-image.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1296\" height=\"810\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1324\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.aeroautoparts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/ford-and-used-ford-auto-parts-in-chicago-il-image.jpg 1296w, https:\/\/www.aeroautoparts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/ford-and-used-ford-auto-parts-in-chicago-il-image-300x188.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.aeroautoparts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/ford-and-used-ford-auto-parts-in-chicago-il-image-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.aeroautoparts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/ford-and-used-ford-auto-parts-in-chicago-il-image-768x480.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1296px) 100vw, 1296px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Before production ceased in 1927, 15 million Model T\u2019s had been sold, making it one of the most popular automobiles of all time. Along the way, in 1917 Ford began producing its first truck, the Model TT, based on a reinforced Model T axis.<\/p>\n<h2>Later Ford classics<\/h2>\n<p>The Model T was soon followed by another Ford classic, the Model A. The first Model A rolled off the Ford assembly line in 1927, and despite the Great Depression, Ford had sold over 5 million Model A\u2019s by 1931.<\/p>\n<p>The ensuing years have seen the introduction of many more Ford classics. 1955 saw the sale of the first Thunderbird, a model that remains popular to this day, followed by the Mustang in 1964. Other currently popular Ford models include the Ford Bronco, Ford Expedition, and of course, the F-150 pickup, the best-selling truck in the U.S. for the past 40 years.<\/p>\n<h2>Used Ford auto and Ford truck parts in Chicago<\/h2>\n<p>No matter how well engineered and well built a vehicle may be, over time parts are going to wear out and need to be replaced, everything from batteries to brake pads, transmissions, motors, and much more.<\/p>\n<p>In today\u2019s market, with the prices of both new and used cars at all time highs, it only makes good sense to keep your current vehicle running as long as possible.
